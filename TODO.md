TODO
====

There are still a lot of stuff to do before this becomes usable in actual work
environments.

- Remove access to currently not working commands like create, add-brick,
remove-brick and any other command involving brick names
- Provide a way to send brick-names properly (possibly a PUSH api for create,
add-brick & remove-brick)
- Proper error replies
- Make listening port, binding interface, base uri etc., configurable
- More stuff that are required to create a proper REST api server
